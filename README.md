# COLLEGE ENQUIRY CHATBOT

This is an implementation of college enquiry chatbot - A mini project as a part of our B.Tech(CSE) final year curriculum. The sentence systhensis is done using NLP and AIML(an XML-like dialect) is used for matching pattern matching.

This project can be used as a prototype for developing more complex chatbots with advanced technologies instead of AIML.

This is a work done using multiple references and feedback. Any part of the project is not used for business purposes and the source code is completely disclosed along with the licenses applicable.
